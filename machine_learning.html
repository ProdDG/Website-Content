                <p>In order to understand machine learning (ML), we first need to understand what artificial intelligence is. According to Built In, ‘Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence’ (Built In n.d., para 1). Machine learning is a subset, or a type, of AI that enhances the accuracy of software applications in predicting outcomes without the method of reaching the result being explicitly programmed into them. In other words, machine learning gives software applications the ability to self-learn, allowing these applications to take in historical data as inputs and predict new output values.</p>
                <p>Currently, there are four basic approaches to the technology of machine learning: supervised learning, reinforcement learning, semi-supervised learning, and unsupervised learning (Burns n.d.). More specifically, these approaches refer to how an algorithm is programmed to increase its accuracy in predicting outcomes. Each approach offers its own set of benefits thus the decision of what technique to use is based on the type of data that the coder wants to predict.</p>
                <p>First of all, supervised learning. With this method, algorithms are provided with labeled training data and the variables that the algorithms should assess for correlations are also defined by the programmer. Furthermore, the coder will define the algorithm’s inputs and outputs.</p>
                <p>Next, unsupervised learning. Here, algorithms train using unlabeled data. The algorithm will perform scans and try to identify any meaningful connection in data sets. This method does have its similarity when compared to supervised learning in that the data fed to the algorithms and the predictions they output are predetermined by the programmer.</p>
                <p>Semi-supervised learning is a rather interesting approach since it combines the two aforementioned techniques. The algorithm may be given mostly labeled data. However, the algorithm will decide how to explore the data by itself and from there, create its own understanding of the data set.</p>
                <p>The final approach to machine learning is reinforcement learning. This is often used when data scientists want to teach an algorithm how to successfully complete a multi-step process that involves defined rules. This approach resembles the hot and cold game. The algorithm is programmed to perform a task and is given cues as it’s performing said task. However, how the algorithm will mostly make its own decision on how to approach the problem.</p>
                <p>If a person from 20 years ago was told of this technology, it would almost seem insane and completely unrealistic. How would a machine be able to guess what we like? However, this futuristic technology is indeed real and a great example of machine learning would be Facebook. With machine learning, Facebook can make the content that appears on each user’s feed more catered to their interest. For example, if a user frequently likes and lingers on posts from a certain group, Facebook will start to show more of that group’s activity in your feed and will even send notifications when someone makes a post in the group. </p>
                <p>Other than being used to upgrade the user experience of a social media platform, machine learning is also being widely used to perform many other important tasks. For example, it is used in improving the process of managing customer relationships. With machine learning, CRM (customer relationship manages) software can analyze emails, allowing members of the sales team to tackle the more important ones first and can even recommend effective responses.</p>
                <p>This technology is also used for human resource information systems, allowing a company to sort through applicants and pick the best candidate for a vacant spot. It’s used in self-driving cars and even virtual assistants to understand users’ voices and understand the context of commands that these assistants receive. Overall, it’s safe to say that machine learning is already in every nook and cranny of our current modern daily lives and it will only grow stronger as AI grows more prominent.</p>
                <p>When we discuss the future of machine learning, there are many exciting advancements to look out for. One of these is quantum computing. With this technology, the capabilities of machine learning will get a huge upgrade, allowing the possibility of performing multi-state operations simultaneously, leading to a quicker process of data. An example of this already exists in current times which is Google’s quantum processor. Back in 2019, this wonderful piece of machinery outclassed the world’s best supercomputers by performing a task that would take 10,000 years to complete in just 200 seconds.</p>
                <p>Currently, many big tech companies are already investing in this technology. As a result, in the near future, businesses will get a massive boost in performance due to quantum machine learning’s ability to improve the process of analyzing data and obtain better insights.</p>
                <p>AutoML (automated machine learning) is another advancement to look out for in the upcoming years. AutoML, as its name suggest, is the process of automating the process of utilizing machine learning algorithms to tackle real-life tasks. This technology allows businesses and personnel to apply complex machine learning models without being an expert in the field, opening it to a broader audience.</p>
                <p>With such advancements, it is unavoidable that some industries will see some changes in the coming years. For example, the healthcare and pharma industry. The healthcare industry has a great amount of data that needs to be sorted through and analyzed. In applying machine learning algorithms, better predictions and treatments will be discovered. The predictions of diseases will be improved, new drugs will be discovered faster, and electronic health records will get an upgrade.</p>
                <p>Despite the rather small appliance of machine learning in the manufacturing industry, in 2020, only 9% of survey respondents were leveraging artificial intelligence in their business processes (Zhydil 2021, para 24), it will definitely become widely spread in the industry in the upcoming years due to the massive benefits that it brings. Machine learning will help reduce costs while bettering quality control and upgrading supply chain management.</p>
                <p>These benefits are no doubt also great news for consumers as the price of products will go down while the quality of said products will only be getting better. However, the process of automation using robots will reduce the need for labor workers and many people will lose their jobs. In contrast, new positions will also appear on the job market. When the manufacturing process becomes entirely, or mostly automated, a small mistake or error in the system will have detrimental consequences, causing the loss of millions of dollars. Thus, it is important that there are skillful engineers with the expertise to manage and monitor the process.</p>
                <p>Another exciting possibility that machine learning brings is the invention of automotive and self-driving vehicles. many of the industry’s giants like Tesla, Toyota, and General Motors are investing more resources into making the vision of complete autonomy a reality. Google is secretly testing its own self-driving cars over hundreds of thousands of miles using technology developed for  DARPA competitions, a series of races created specifically for driverless cars. Mass-market saturation might be 30 years, according to The Economist, but in the next five years, tens of thousands of AVs will be on the road (The Economist 2018).</p>
                <p>When this vision becomes a reality, there will be little need for human drivers in the market and as such, many drivers will unavoidably be laid off. Companies like Uber or Grab will have to dramatically shift their business to that of a self-driving taxis provider. New occupations will be given birth, an example is the AV emote mechanic/engineer (AV remote mechanic/engineer), a combination of “remote droid mechanic” and “backup test pilot”.</p>
                <p>All these major changes and impacts that machine has on our society will no doubt impact my daily life and the everyday life of those around me as well. For example, if our society ever reaches the point of fully automated vehicles, the possession of a driver’s license will become pointless. We will no longer have to memorize the many complicated laws, road signs, and get into trouble with traffic police. Traveling from point A to point B will become effortless. Parking won’t be a worry since our vehicle can just drop us at our destination, go find a place to park, and come pick us up when you are finished. Finally, there won’t be frequent traffic jams (if at all) due to the absence of accidents.</p>
