                <p>With the world developing at an increasing rate, cybersecurity has become more and more important in our daily lives that will soon prove to be indispensable in the foreseeable future. Cybersecurity in short, is the protection of internet-related systems from cyber-attacks also known as cyberthreats. Big companies always opt for well-known cybersecurity services to establish their reputation regarding the protection of their clients’ information. In 2021, the state-of-the-art cybersecurity technologies are: AI & Deep Learning, Behavioral Analytics, Embedded Hardware Authentication, Blockchain Cybersecurity, and Zero-Trust Model (according to IFF’s article on “The 5 Latest Cyber Security Technologies”). It is a cybersecurity analyst’s job to protect his company’s hardware, software, and networks from unauthorized sources, although they might vary from place to place. There are a few tasks pulled from real job listings such as: Monitor network traffic, investigate incidents in real time, write detailed response reports, install and operate firewalls, fix vulnerabilities, etc. (according to Coursera’s article on “What does a cybersecurity analyst do?”).</p>
                <p>In 3 years’ time, it is most likely going to change the way we live our lives forever, since with the impacts of COVID-19, hundreds of millions have to work from home, data protection has never been such a crux as it is today. It is predicted that secure by default will become the norm (says “Top 6 Cybersecurity Predictions for 2022” - Matthew Hughes, October 20, 2021), as with more and more data breaches and cyberthreats, vendors are expected to take a more “proactive approach in creating guardrails for their customers” and a “Secure by Design” approach will become the default. It is also speculated that “Diversity of Thought and Skill will be regarded as an Asset”, as the security landscape is continuously evolving, and that the IT teams will have to face increasingly sophisticated threats, with attacks delivered in greater volume over a variety of mediums. According to a recent paper of Bridewell Consulting, a cybersecurity services company, on this subject on December 07, 2021, it is said that the Zero-Trust Model will become the “de facto cybersecurity approach” in the upcoming years with the rise of 5G and internet-based devices. Organizations will shift to hybrid models with a group of in-house teams of experts in Cybersecurity, which will change the focus from prevention to detection and response. The technologies that make this possible are mostly going to be AI and Deep Learning as the volume of cyberthreats will be increasing exponentially with ransomware being automated. Experts will have to “up their game” in order to be able to fend off such threats, both externally and internally.</p>
                <p>This development will likely encourage digital transformation for business owners to opt for cybersecurity services as a business enabler, rather than just a safety procedure. Cybersecurity vendors like Google and Microsoft, says Bridewell Consulting, will start to consolidate and be widely noticed after having invested billions of dollars into the field. This is, as expected from the top companies in the world, undeniably an innovative and revolutionary step towards the future. They were able to foresee the potential of cybersecurity as well as possible threats that we users, customers would have to face with the rapid development of network and technology. Unlike most other industries where the transformation into digital usage replaces the need of the human hands, cybersecurity on the other hand, requires more workforce as the need for cybersecurity experts is escalating quickly, which makes it one of the most trending and sought-after jobs over the last decade. However, the workload of analysts will shift to become more housebound and internal as other problems will highly likely be solved with the use of AI and Deep Learning.</p>
                <p>Personally, as a customer who has been used to using cybersecurity services, this will help me further protect my personal information during the course of either my work or entertainment. Such developments help us feel more relieved when using the internet worry-free as well as giving us more insight regarding the importance of cybersecurity in years to come. Paying for security procedures will start becoming the norm among households, schools and workplaces, making it a high priority just as food and clothes.</p>
