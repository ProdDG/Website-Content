                    Project Ideas
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p> We would like to create an interactive map of the school campus of RMIT Hanoi. This can be accomplished easily using free online tools like Visme. For now, the end product will be a simple map that can be shared online with interested parties. However, in the future, this idea can be revisited and made better by creating a mobile app or setting up a website for easier access and usage.</p>
                <h2>
                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>Since the Hanoi campus is situated in the Handi Resco Building shared by many other businesses, the school only occupies certain floors and the gate for students to enter is located in the back which is confusing for anyone visiting RMIT for the first time. Furthermore, for freshmen, it’s rather difficult finding the correct room using the limited information found on the student canvas. For example, on November 4th I had my first in-person class but I struggled in locating my classroom since canvas only provided me with 1.10.002 as the room number. Without the help of a classmate, I wouldn’t understand that 1.10.002 means it’s the second room on the 10th floor. Moreover, many returning students had difficulty locating the area for health declaration. For such reasons, This map will be useful for freshmen, visitors, and even returning students in locating their desired destinations.</p>
                <h2>
                    Description
                </h2>
                <p>The map will include every floor and display the location of classrooms, faculty rooms, toilets, elevators, etc. The rooms will be color-coded depending on their primary usage. For example, staff rooms will be red, classrooms gray, toilets blue, and so on. Each room will be labeled with the room number and name. An example would be:</p>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>Anyone can make a private copy of the map and edit the information displayed when hovering over the rooms. For instance, students can add the time and name of the class into the room that will be used. In my case, I would add “Introduction to Information Technology Tutorial, 2:30 pm – 4 pm” to room 1.10.002. It would be a convenient way for students to store and check information about their class without having to go through the hassle of opening up the timetable or student canvas.
                    These will be the base features of this map. They are rather simple but I want the project to be accomplishable with my current limited skills and knowledge. However, when I am more familiar with various tools and programming languages, I plan to create an app for smartphones and a website hosting the map. This way I can add features such as a live tracking GPS which helps users reach the destination faster using the fastest route or find their friends easier by sharing their real-time location. Another feature I would add is the option to subscribe to your schedule stored in the app so that forgetful students won’t miss a day of class ever again. Moreover, if I can get permission from the university, I will connect the app with the school’s database so that it can display which rooms are being used by who throughout the day. This can help students or teachers to find and book a free room more effortlessly.</p>
                <h2>
                    Tools/Technologies used and Skills required 
                </h2>
                <p>To begin, I will use a tape measure and get permission from RMIT to go around and measure all the rooms and hallways. After that, I will use Bluebeam to draw a floor plan and adjust it to scale. If I can get access to the floor plan of the Handi Resco Building or of the floors that RMIT’s facilities are located on, I can skip these two steps and focus on the map’s design. The map will be drawn on Visme, an open-sourced tool. The information of every room will also be included in this step. The map will then be published publicly. Anyone interested can download it and make modifications that suit their own needs. All the steps mentioned up to this point can be accomplished by anyone familiar with the tools mentioned (Bluebeam, Visme) and will be sufficient for the base features of my project idea. 
                    In the future, I want to release an app and possibly a website. I am currently learning Python which will help with turning this vision into reality. However, it’s far from enough. I plan to study C++ and Java for developing an app containing my map as well as learn HTML and PHP for creating a website for laptop and PC users.</p>
                <h2>
                    Outcome
                </h2>
                <p>If successful, this project will increase the campus accessibility for students, visitors, and faculty by offering a user-friendly, interactive map that provides information on every room in the campus along with how to get there. Moreover, the app can potentially be the go-to tool for both current and future RMIT students due to its ability to store class details, send reminders, and assist in finding open rooms for group activities and projects.</p>
