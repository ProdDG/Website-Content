    Personal Information:
  </h2>
  <p>
    My name is Nguyen Tuan Anh (s3911444). I can speak English, Vietnamese and a little bit of Japanese. I am currently studying at RMIT University. My hobbies are playing games, reading books and experimenting with new things to seek excitement. I am deeply passionate in the gaming industry and always curious about the mechanics and operations behind the screen of these masterpieces. I learnt programming basics in middle school and I also got introduced to python programming language later in high school. My dream is to become a game developer and create a game that the world can enjoy.
