                <p>Our group has chosen the route of discussing web sources to get a broader sample. By hearing from multiple IT professionals with different specialties, cultural backgrounds, lifestyles, identities, etc., we can gain a better understanding of the industry and the people working within it.</p>
                <p>IT professionals tend to wear many hats. They take up many jobs, from managing tickets and helping clients resolve their issues to monitoring networks and systems (The Bearded I.T. Dad, 2018). We looked into the work-life of many IT professionals, some working as admins for IT systems, some as Cyber Security Engineers, and much more. </p>
                <p>Through our research, we found that a day of an IT professional usually consists of checking tickets and responding to emails (DC CyberSec, 2019). This process is usually involved with helping clients, assisting them with the problems they are having. For example, getting the server back up. IT workers also write reports to sync their work with co-workers and frequently hold meetings to brainstorm solutions (PushToProd, 2019).</p>
                <p>Other than that, IT professionals’ work varies from day to day. They can be involved with monitoring their services, scanning for vulnerabilities, then reporting and patching them. They manage the employees’ mobile devices to make sure said devices are up to date (The Bearded I.T. Dad, 2018). For Network Operations Centre Engineers, their work tends to include checking on the infrastructure to report or fix any issues (Custodian Data Centres, 2018).</p>
                <p>One of the sources covered the work of a Software Engineer at Google (Sierra Nguyen, 2020). In the video, he was checking pull requests from a co-worker and worked on an application where users can make and interact with storybooks. However, he also mentioned that his work varies daily and he finds it exciting. Some days, his work is focused on bug fixing, dealing with security issues, and even interviewing potential new hires for the company.</p>
                <p>IT professionals can work at the office, at home, or both (PushToProd, 2019). For days that have meetings, it is obligatory to come to the office. Other than that, IT workers tend to work at home, especially during the pandemic. </p>
                <p>The most challenging part about the work of an IT professional would be its unpredictability (I.T. Career Questions, 2016). Every day an IT worker shows up to work, there will be different challenges and issues that need to be solved. Thus, it’s important for IT workers to not only be an expert in their own field but also to be knowledgeable about other related fields. The ability to communicate and work well with others, whether they are clients or co-workers, is also a must.</p>
